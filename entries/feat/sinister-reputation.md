**Prerequisites:** Cha 13; Intimidate 5 ranks; [Persuasive](ref/feat/persuasive) or renown social
talent.\
**Benefit:** By spending 8 hours cultivating your local legend in a settlement and then succeeding
at an Intimidate check, your fearsome reputation becomes common knowledge. The DC is based on the
[size of the settlement](ref/rule/the-shape-of-civilization) (see the Sinister Reputation table
below). If the check succeeds, you can attempt an [Intimidate](ref/skill/intimidate) check to
demoralize a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than you as a swift action, and using Intimidate to
force a creature to act friendly to you takes only half as long. You gain these benefits only while
within the settlement and while not disguised. These benefits last for a number of days equal to
your half your level + your Charisma modifier.\
**Special:** This feat's benefits always apply to a [vigilante's](ref/class/vigilante) area of
