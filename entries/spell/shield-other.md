:::

This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that
some of its wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1
resistance bonus on saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and
attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of
damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit
points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not
affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the
reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent
damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned
to the subject.

If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.
