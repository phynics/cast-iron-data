:::

You unleash a wave of necromantic energy that snuffs out the life force of those in its path. This
wave pulses out from you in a line 5 feet wide and 30 feet long. The wave visibly rips the souls
from the bodies of those it passes through, which manifest as screaming, transparent versions of the
affected creatures. The wave kills every living creature of 17 or fewer HD in the line, starting
with the creature closest to you, to a maximum of 1d4 HD of creatures per caster level. No creature
of 18 or more HD can be affected. If a creature succeeds at its saving throw or has too many HD, it
doesn't count against the HD the spell can kill The wave continues to affect creatures as it rolls
away from you until you either run out of HD to affect or reach the limit of the spell's area. If
the spell does not kill any creatures, the unreleased necromantic energy violently explodes in the
final square of the 60-foot line, dealing 10d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level to any
creature in that square with no saving throw. If several creatures occupy the same square, roll
randomly to determine which is affected.
