You combat the rising [corruption](ref/rule/corruption) in another creature or advance the long-term
process of exorcising it entirely. This spell has two purposes, and you choose which application to
use at the time of casting.

_Combat Corruption:_ Each time a creature fails a saving throw to prevent its corruption from
progressing (as described in that corruption's Progression section), it advances to the next
corruption stage-at stage 3, it loses the battle against its corruption. Using this spell can lower
the target's corruption stage by 1. This has no effect if the target isn't at progression stage of 1
or higher.

_Remove Corruption:_ You can remove 1 manifestation level from the target creature, as well as the
most recently acquired manifestation and its corresponding gift and stain. Doing this also reduces
the power of gifts and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of
alleviate corruption doesn't reduce the target's corruption stage. If the target creature loses all
manifestation levels, it is cured of the corruption.

Either application of the spell requires a caster level check. The DC is equal to 10 + double the
target's manifestation level + 3 times the target's corruption stage (effectively 0, 3, or 6, since
stage 3 removes the character from player control).

Tampering with corruptions is dangerous, as their nature is contagious. If you fail this caster
level check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation (the rules for the
useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is
an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate
saving throw against it. Casting alleviate corruption on yourself automatically fails, as does
casting it on a target who has fully succumbed to a corruption (failed three saving throws against
it). A creature can be the beneficiary of this spell only once per week, whether it succeeds or not.
