You create a comforting phantasm, which leeches onto the psyche of a nearby target. The creature can
attempt a Will saving throw to prevent the phantasm from entering its psyche, but otherwise it takes
up permanent residence in the creature's mind. The phantasm fills its target's dreams with happy
visions, comforting manifestations of loved ones, and incredible vistas, feeding the target a
perfect fantasy life it never wishes to leave. After the target's next night's sleep, the target
must succeed at a Will saving throw to wake up; otherwise, it remains asleep for the rest of the day
and following night. Each night it must succeed at a new saving throw or remain asleep for days or
weeks on end as it slowly starves to death (presuming it normally needs to eat to survive). Loud
noises, jostling, and even pain won't rouse the slumbering target. Dealing 1 point of damage per the
target's Hit Die awakens the target, but it awakens fatigued and takes a -2 penalty on all saving
throws against spells and effects that may put it back to sleep until the phantasm has been
banished.

The phantasm remains in its host's mind indefinitely, requiring a new Will saving throw to wake up
every time the target rests, until it is removed via
[break enchantment](ref/spell/break-enchantment),
[greater restoration](ref/spell/restoration-greater), or [miracle](ref/spell/miracle).
Alternatively, the phantasm can be confronted in its host's [mindscape](ref/rule/mindscapes), where
it manifests as a slothful duplicate of its host with identical abilities, skills, and attributes.
