**Sources:** Horror Adventures pg. 32-33\
Your body is slowly wasting away. As your body decays, you must gradually replace more and more of
it with artificial components - corpse flesh, bone, wood, metal, or other exotic materials.

### Catalyst

This corruption stems from experimentation designed to create or extend life - perhaps you were a
willing participant in an alchemist's research or brought back from the dead by an unconventional
means that robbed you of your humanity.

### Progression

Whenever you fail a Fortitude save against any effect or fall below 0 hit points, you must attempt a
Fortitude save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level). If you fail that save, some of the living
components of your body begin to fail. Within the next 3 days, you or someone you trust must spend 8
hours replacing more of your body with construct parts. If you don't do so, you die, and even if you
are brought back from the dead with [resurrection](ref/spell/resurrection) or
[true resurrection](ref/spell/true-resurrection) (which are necessary since your body isn't viable),
you still must perform the operation or you die again in 3 days. After an operation, there is a 50%
chance your corruption progresses to the next stage. If it doesn't, the DC of the above Fortitude
save increases by 2 until your corruption reaches the next stage. These increases stack.

While your body parts are failing (after you've failed the Fort save but before you've repaired your
body), you don't have to attempt additional saves when you fail a Fortitude save or fall below 0 hit
points. Once you've been repaired, you need to attempt saves in these circumstances again.

**Corruption Stage 1**

**Details:** The first time your corruption progresses, you fall into routines easily, performing
repetitive actions. Your alignment shifts one step toward neutral.

**Corruption Stage 2**

**Details:** The second time your corruption progresses, you find you can't bring yourself to care
about things or even to love. Your alignment shifts to neutral.

**Corruption Stage 3**

**Details:** The third time your corruption progresses, too much of your body is gone for your soul
to remain. You become a mindless, destructive automaton or free-willed evil construct under the GM's
control.

### Removing the Corruption

Getting rid of a corruption requires invasive surgery to remove the artificial components fused to
your body. Even these procedures might not cure your underlying wasting, so you might need to scour
medical and alchemical tomes and consult divine spellcasters for a safer procedure than replacing
your body parts in the way you were before. Powerful magic like [miracle](ref/spell/miracle) or
[wish](ref/spell/wish) in conjunction with [regenerate](ref/spell/regenerate) might strip the
components from your body and prevent the wasting.

### Manifestations

The following are manifestations of the promethean corruption.

**Armored**

**Flavor:** Your body is unnaturally hardened against attacks.

**Special:** Upon receiving this manifestation, you must take both the gift and the stain, even with
the _useful corruption_ or _vile corruption_ [variants](ref/rule/corruption-variants).

**Gift:** Plates bolted to your bones or flesh like leather protect your body. You gain a +1 natural
armor bonus to your AC.

At manifestation level 5th, this bonus increases to +2.

**Stain:** Your take a -1 penalty on Dexterity- and Strength-based skill checks.

At manifestation level 5th, this penalty changes to -2.

**Berserk Fury**

**Flavor:** The only emotion left to you is rage.

**Special:** Upon receiving this manifestation, you must take both the gift and the stain, even with
the _useful corruption_ or _vile corruption_ [variants](ref/rule/corruption-variants).

**Gift:** You can voluntarily enter an enraged state as a **free action** for a number of rounds per
day equal to your manifestation level; these rounds don't have to be consecutive. Once you end this
state, you can't enter it again for 1 minute. While enraged, you gain a +2 bonus on attack and
damage rolls, 1 temporary hit point per character level, and a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves.

You are in control of yourself during this rage, but you must still succeed at a Will save to resist
losing control (as detailed in this manifestation's stain). While voluntarily enraged, you take a -2
penalty on Will saves.

**Stain:** When you're hit by a critical hit or drop below half your maximum hit points, you must
succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) or become enraged for a number of rounds
equal to your manifestation level. You gain the benefits of this manifestation's gift, but you're
completely out of control, making melee attacks against the nearest creature (roll randomly if there
are multiple targets).

**Greater Armored**

**Flavor:** Your body is covered in thick armored plating.

**Prereq:** Manifestation level 5th, armored

**Gift:** Your natural armor bonus to your AC from the armored manifestation increases by 2.

**Prereq:** Manifestation level 5th, armored, shattered body

**Special:** You can gain this manifestation only if you have failed another corruption progression
saving throw and replaced more of your body with construct parts since the time you took _shattered
body._

**Gift:** Your body is almost entirely artificial, save for a few organic components tethering you
to your original life. Your bonus on saving throws against poison and diseases from _shattered body_
is equal to your manifestation level. You automatically stabilize when you are below 0 hit points.
You no longer need to eat, drink, or sleep. You must still rest for at least 8 hours to prepare
spells.

**Stain:** Most of your internal organs have been replaced. You can no longer benefit from potions,
elixirs, extracts, or any other beneficial item that requires consumption.

**Greater Shattered Mind**

**Flavor:** You can understand no emotion but rage.

**Prereq:** Manifestation level 6th, corruption stage 2, shattered mind

**Gift:** You become immune to all mind-affecting emotion effects, except those that produce
emotions of rage, hatred, or anger.

**Stain:** You have lost the ability to understand love or joy. You can't benefit from morale
bonuses or bardic performances.

**Flavor:** When you fly into a rage, you destroy everything nearby.

**Prereq:** Berserk fury

**Gift:** While enraged, you deal double damage to objects and gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks to
break objects.

**Stain:** Returning from the heights of fury takes a toll on your body. You are
[staggered](ref/misc/staggered) for 1 minute after ending a rage of any kind (including berserk
fury, [barbarian](ref/class/barbarian) rage, and the [rage](ref/spell/rage) spell). Nothing can
remove this condition, nor does immunity to being staggered prevent it.

**Replacement Limb**

**Flavor:** One of your arms has been replaced by a prosthetic.

**Prereq:** Armored, shattered body

**Gift:** You gain one slam attack as a primary [natural weapon](ref/umr/natural-attacks). This slam
deals 1d6 points of damage if your size is Medium (1d4 if Small).

**Stain:** You take a -2 penalty on Dexterity-based skill checks and ability checks using your
hands, as well as on Dexterity-based attack rolls.

**Shattered Body**

**Flavor:** The last time you added more construct parts to your body, you reached a tipping point.

**Prereq:** Armored

**Special:** You can gain this manifestation only if you have failed at least one corruption
progression saving throw and replaced more of your body with construct parts.

**Gift:** You gain a bonus on Fortitude saves against poison and disease equal to half your
manifestation level. Additionally, you require only half as much food and water as normal, and half
as much rest as normal to gain a full night's sleep. However, you must still rest for at least 8
hours to prepare spells.

**Stain:** You are treated as both a construct and your original creature type for spells and
effects that target creatures by type (such as the [bane](ref/magic-enh/bane) weapon special ability
or a ranger's [favored enemy](ref/ability/favored-enemy) class feature).

**Shattered Mind**

**Flavor:** Your transformation damaged your psyche.

**Prereq:** Corruption Stage 1 or 2

**Gift:** Your dulled emotions are more difficult to affect with magic. You gain a +2 bonus on Will
saves against emotion effects, and if you have this manifestation's stain, you don't need to roll
twice and take the lower result against them. This doesn't apply to emotion effects that cause rage,
hatred, or anger.

At manifestation level 5th, this bonus increases to +4.

**Stain:** Now easy to manipulate, you roll twice and take the lower result against compulsion
effects.
